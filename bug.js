The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a database reference before it's fully initialized. This can happen if you're calling database functions too early in your app's lifecycle, before the Firebase app has completed its initialization process.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect: Accessing the database before initialization completes
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = firebase.firestore();
db.collection('users').add({name: 'John Doe'}); // This might throw an error!
```

This often manifests as a silent failure, where the operation seems to not execute instead of throwing a clear error message.
